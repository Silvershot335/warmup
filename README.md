# How to Use WARMUP.cfg

Download file (or copy contents and paste in a text editing program) and have the saved file present as a .txt file.

Rename the file to whatever you want, but have the file end in ".cfg" (e.g. Warmup.cfg)

Copy "Warmup.cfg" and go to your "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg" folder and simply drop it in or paste it in.

Open CS:GO and select the map you would like to play in under Offline With Bots.

Open Command prompt with "`/~" key.

Type "exec warmup"
